This project was completed to satisfy the elective project in the MIT Applied Science Program.  

Objective:  
Use the provided data and follow the requirements to develop a model that can accurately classify numbers in images.

Background:
In the Applied Data Science Program we had several elective paths to choose from, and I chose to focus on Machine Learning. This was the first project in this category.  
In this project, I was provided a Jupyter Notebook containing basic instructions and I was responsible for producing all code and insights learned.
